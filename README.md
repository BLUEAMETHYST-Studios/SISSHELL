# SISSHELL
Custom Shell (Based on Windows CMD), coded with Python

## How to install
SISSHELL allows you to use essential commands, which were inspired from the Windows CMD and Linux' Bash.
To use SISSHELL, execute the installer with PowerShell.
After it's installed open CMD and type "sis".
If you want to have this in your Terminal (Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store),
just add it by creating a new profile and then choose the EXE in %LOCALAPPDATA%/SISSHELL/sis.exe as Command Prompt.
